### Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident

**The network protocols involved in this attack include:**  
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Facilitates data transfer between the web browser and the website.  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures reliable communication between devices on a network.

**The DNS logs show:**  
- DNS resolution requests for `yummyrecipesforme.com` and `greatrecipesforme.com` returning valid IP addresses.  
- These requests were followed by HTTP connections to both domains over port 80.

**This indicates the attacker used DNS and TCP/HTTP to redirect users to a malicious domain after gaining access to the server.**

### Section 2: Document the incident

**Summary of what occurred:**  
- The attacker gained unauthorized access to the web server via a brute force password attack.  
- They altered the source code of `yummyrecipesforme.com`, embedding JavaScript that prompted visitors to download a fake browser update.  
- The executable file included a redirect to `greatrecipesforme.com`, a malicious site containing malware.

**Key timeline from tcpdump logs:**  
- At `14:18:32`, DNS query for `yummyrecipesforme.com` initiated and resolved.  
- HTTP GET request issued and responded to on port 80.  
- At `14:20:32`, DNS query for `greatrecipesforme.com` initiated and resolved.  
- At `14:25:29`, browser sends HTTP GET to the malicious site, completing the redirect.

**Impact:**  
- Customer trust was compromised due to infection via a redirected download.  
- Website administrator locked out due to password change by attacker.  
- Malware infection led to performance issues on user devices.

### Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks

**Recommended action:**  
Implement account lockout policies and two-factor authentication (2FA) for all administrative access.  

**Additional suggestions:**  
- Enforce strong password requirements.  
- Monitor for repeated failed login attempts.  
- Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block brute force attempts.
