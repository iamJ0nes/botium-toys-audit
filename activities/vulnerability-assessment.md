title: Public Database Server Vulnerability Assessment  
difficulty: Moderate  
estimated_time: 25 minutes  
---

### 🧠 Overview  
This case study evaluates a critical vulnerability found in an e-commerce company's remote database server, which has been publicly accessible since launch. The assessment outlines potential risks, threat actors, and a remediation strategy following guidance from NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

# Vulnerability Assessment Report  
**Date:** 16 April 2025

## 🖥️ System Description  
The database server hosts customer and sales data for a globally distributed e-commerce team. It runs on a modern Linux distribution and supports a MySQL-based database. Although it has strong compute resources and consistent connectivity, it lacks essential access controls. The server is publicly exposed to the internet, allowing unauthenticated connections from any IP address. No MFA, allow-lists, or auditing mechanisms are in place.

---

## 📌 Scope  
This assessment reviews risks associated with unrestricted remote access to the database server. The period under review spans three months (January–March 2025). The evaluation is guided by NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 and focuses on access control weaknesses and exposure to external threat actors.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The remote database is a core part of business operations, storing leads, customer records, and sales intelligence. Protecting this system is essential to preserving data confidentiality and maintaining operational trust. If compromised or taken offline, the company risks legal consequences, customer loss, and reputational damage.

## 🔍 Risk Assessment

| Threat Source    | Threat Event                                  | Likelihood (1–3) | Severity (1–3) | Risk (L×S) |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Malicious hacker | Unauthorized access to sensitive data         | 3                | 3              | 9          |
| Insider threat   | Data exfiltration or deletion                 | 2                | 3              | 6          |
| Botnet scanning  | Automated discovery and exploitation          | 3                | 2              | 6          |
| Competitor       | Strategic targeting of business intelligence  | 2                | 3              | 6          |
| Accidental breach| Misconfiguration by remote employees          | 2                | 2              | 4          |

## 🧩 Approach  
Risks were evaluated using a qualitative model that considers threat likelihood and impact severity. Each identified risk was rated from 1 (low) to 3 (high) and multiplied to produce an overall risk score. The analysis focused on open network exposure and access control misconfigurations.

## 🛠️ Remediation Strategy  
- 🔐 **Authentication & Access Control**:  
  - Enforce strong password policies  
  - Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
  - Implement role-based access controls

- 🧱 **Network Restrictions**:  
  - Apply IP allow-lists to restrict access to known corporate locations  
  - Close unused ports and disable public-facing database access

- 📈 **Monitoring & Auditing**:  
  - Enable logging of database queries and access attempts  
  - Configure alerting for abnormal access patterns

- 🔐 **Data Encryption**:  
  - Use TLS encryption for all data in transit  
  - Deprecate legacy SSL protocols

- ⚙️ **Routine Patch Management**:  
  - Ensure OS and database software are up to date  
  - Monitor for CVEs related to exposed services

---

✅ **Summary**  
The publicly accessible remote database represents a significant risk to the organization. By implementing layered access control, encryption, and network segmentation, the system can be hardened to meet modern cybersecurity expectations and support ongoing business operations securely.
