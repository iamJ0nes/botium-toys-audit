# Next Steps

**Planned Enhancements:**

### 🖼️ Visual Artifacts
- Incorporate a simulated network diagram to illustrate system architecture (`assets/network.png`)
- Include representative log entries for audit analysis (`logs/sample-logs.log`)
- Add screenshots from vulnerability scans and analysis tools to demonstrate assessment workflow (`screenshots/`)

### 📄 Detailed Reports
- Document a simulated vulnerability scan and provide findings and recommendations
- Create a STRIDE-based threat model diagram to highlight risk categories
- Develop an incident response timeline to demonstrate preparedness and lifecycle handling

### 🌐 Interactive Options (Optional)
- Publish an interactive version of the audit using GitHub Pages for public presentation
